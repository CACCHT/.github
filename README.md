# Creating Annotated Corpora of Classical Hebrew Text (CACCHT)

The goal of CACCHT is to prepare and publish ancient Semitic texts digitally that can be used for research. The project is a collaboration of Martijn Naaijer, Christian Canu Højgaard, Martin Ehrensvärd, Robert Rezetko, Oliver Glanz, and Willem van Peursen. The goal of CACCHT is to prepare and publish linguistically annotated ancient Semitic texts that can be used for research and education.

We work on the following sub-projects:

* [dss](https://github.com/etcbc/dss) Dead Sea Scrolls
* [sp](https://github.com/dt-ucph/sp) Samaritan Pentateuch
* [cuc](https://github.com/DT-UCPH/cuc) Copenhagen Ugaritic Corpus

The annotation conventions of these datasets are based on that of the [Biblica Hebaica Stuttgartensia Amstelodamensis](https://github.com/etcbc/dss), which was developed by the [Eep Talstra Center for Bible and Computer](https://etcbc.nl).

# CACCHT: Creating Annotated Corpora of Classical Hebrew Text

The CACCHT project is a collaboration of Martijn Naaijer (University of Zurich), Willem van Peursen (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam), Oliver Glanz (Andrews University), Martin Ehrensv√§rd (University of Copenhagen) and Robert Rezetko (University of Copenhagen).
Together with specialists in the field we develop linguistically annotated datsets of Semitic texts. These datasets are publicly available and can be used freely for research and education. Some datasets have only word level annotations, others have also syntactic features.

The following datasets are the result of our work:

- [The Dead Sea Scrolls](https://github.com/etcbc/dss)
- [The ETCBC Syriac Corpus](https://github.com/etcbc/syriac)
- [The Samaritan Pentateuch](https://github.com/DT-UCPH/sp)
- [The Copenhagen Ugaritic Corpus](https://github.com/dt-ucph/cuc)

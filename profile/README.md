# CACCHT: Creating Annotated Corpora of Classical Hebrew Texts

The CACCHT project is a collaboration of Martijn Naaijer (University of Zurich), Willem van Peursen (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam), Oliver Glanz (Andrews University), Christian Canu Højgaard (Fjellhaug International University College), Martin Ehrensvärd (University of Copenhagen) and Robert Rezetko (University of Copenhagen).  
Together with specialists in the field we develop linguistically annotated datsets of Semitic texts. These datasets are publicly available and can be used freely for research and education. Some datasets have only word-level annotations, while others also contain syntactic features.

## Datasets
We are working on the following datasets:

- [The Dead Sea Scrolls](https://github.com/etcbc/dss)
- [The ETCBC Syriac Corpus](https://github.com/etcbc/syriac)
- [The Samaritan Pentateuch](https://github.com/DT-UCPH/sp)
- [The Copenhagen Ugaritic Corpus](https://github.com/dt-ucph/cuc)

## Text-Fabric
All the datasets are [Text-Fabric](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric/tf/) datasets and can be accessed and used with Python.

## BHSA
There is an important role for the [Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia Amstelodamensis (BHSA)](https://etcbc.github.io/bhsa) in this project. The BHSA is the dataset of the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible with linguistic annotations that is developed and maintained by the [ETCBC](https://etcbc.nl). In general, CACCHT follows the annotation conventions of the BHSA and we adapt them for the specific characteristics of a language or text.
